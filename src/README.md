### Source Code

These are the Arudino sketch source files.  All three files are required and, at a minimum, you must edit the Credentials.h file to update the information for your WiFi and MQTT broker.

There are likely other options in the Settings.h file that you may wish to change and a section of the main .ino file that sets initial presets that you may also want to review.

Please see the Wiki sections on [Credentials and Settings](https://github.com/Resinchem/FM-Receiver-MQTT/wiki/02-‐-Credentials-and-Settings) and [Installation](https://github.com/Resinchem/FM-Receiver-MQTT/wiki/03-‐-Installation) for more information
